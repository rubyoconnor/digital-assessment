	<h2>Describing Relevant Implications</h2>
	<h3> Usability</h3>
	<h4>Usability means that the user can intutively learn the 
		program quickly. Options are easy to understand and it is 
		easy to find appropriate actions. The program has error prevention 
		methods and communicates to the user about then. 

	<h3>Functionality</h3>
	<h4>Functionality means that the program must work properly. This means 
		it does not crash, it does not do incorrect arithemetic and variables
		are all reset once order is complete. The program should work as intended. 

	<h3>Sustainability and Future Proofing</h3>
	<h4>Sustainability and future proofing is making the program
		so that it is able to be updated and maintained. The program
		should be able to have new feature added reasonably easily. It should
		be able to be handed over to another developer and they should be able to understand it quickly.

	<h3>Sprint 1 Review</h3>
	<h4> In my first sprint, the user can only print the menu and quit the program. 
		It is set up in a loop which is good as it makes it easy for future sprints and additions. 
		In the next sprint I am going to add a function that enables the user to add a pasta to their order.

	<h3>Sprint 2 Review</h3>
	<h4> In sprint 2, the user can now also add pasta to their order. Although I have
		not added a order_list into the main function so when the user adds pasta there is 
		a message saying "You have added (quantity) (name of pasta) to your order". This is to inform the user
		that adding their order was successful. But there is not actually an order_list in which the pasta is 
		added to. In the next sprint (sprint 3) I am going to add in a function so that the user can review their order.
		In this sprint I will add in the order_list in the main function and make it so when the user adds pasta to their order it
		will be added the users order to the order_list.

	<h3>Sprint 3 Review</h3>
	<h4> In this sprint, I added in a review_order function which enables the user
		to be able to see the current order and the price including the overall total. 
		To be able to do this I had to change the prices in the pasta_list to be integers. 
		A problem with the review order at the moment is that if you order a meal and then
		order the same thing again, the program does not add these together and counts them separatly. 
		(this is shown in the photo above). Something important which was added 
		in this sprint is order_list in the main function. When the user orders a pasta this is added and stored in the 
		order list. 
		
		In sprint 4, I am going to create a delete_from_order function in which the user can remove pastas from their order.

	<h3>A problem I came across whilst testing my code is that when you delete a pasta 
		completely (2 pastas were in the order and the user removes the 2) is that when
	reviewing the order the pasta saying 0 x and the pasta. This can be seen below.  </h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_4_problem.jpg" alt=""> 

	<h2>Trialling</h2>
	<h3>I trialled two different way to fix the problem above</h3>
	<h4>First I tried to use order_list.remove to try and remove the pasta when it equalled 0.</h4>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_4removetrial.jpg" alt=""> 
	<h4>This did not work as when using remove you have use the actual name of the thing in the list. Eg. Ravioli di Ricotta
		So order_list.remove wouldn't work as I cannot predict which pasta needs to be removed from the list. 
	</h4>

	<h3>I trialled using order_list.pop</h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_4_code_fixed.jpg" alt=""> 
	<h3>This worked as I could it would remove "which_index" and did not need the specific name.  </h3>
	
	<h3>This is what the output looks like now that it's fixed</h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_4_output_fixed.jpg" alt=""> 

	<h3>In order to make testing my code quicker. I put some pasta into the order_list.</h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/order_list.jpg" alt=""> 



	<h3>Sprint 4 Review</h3>
	<h4> In this sprint, I added in a delete_from_order function. This enables the user to be able to 
		delete an item from their order. The user is able to choose which pasta they would like to remove and how
		many. A problem that occured is that if user trys to remove more of a certain pasta when than they have in their order. 
		When this happens in the review function the order will show up as -1 (or how every many) x the pasta. To fix I changed it so that 
		if the user try to delete more pastas that the amount they have ordered it won't go into negatives and will just remove that pasta 
		completely. This should be fixed later but doesn't really effect the user if it is not. In sprint 5, I will be adding in a function 
		so that the user can choose delivery or pick up.

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_5_deliveryfee.jpg" alt=""> 
	<h4>Code that I added in the review function so that a delivery fee of $3 would
		be added to the total. I made a delivery_details and pickup_details list in the main
		function. In the delivery_pick_up function when it was delivery the details would be added to 
		both the customer_details list and delivery_details list and if the user chose pickup then the 
		details are added into both customer_details and the pickup_details list. I did this so that 
		I could have the pickup_details and delivery details in different lists but also have a list (customer_details)
		which have either. 
	</h4>

	<h3>If user trys to enter their pickup or delivery details twice.</h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_5_details_twice.jpg" alt=""> 
	<h4>This is the code that stopped the user from adding their details twice. If the 
		customer_details list is full then the program will ask if the user would like to 
		clear the details previously entered or exit back to the menu. If the user would like to
		clear the previous information then all three list customer_details, pickup_details and 
		delivery_details are cleared. This is so if the user previously entered delivery and then 
		wanted to change to pickup the delivery fee wouldn't be there and delivery_details was also cleared. 
	</h4>
	
	<h3>Sprint 5 Review</h3>
	<h4> In this sprint, I added in a delivery_pick_up function. The user is able to choose if they want to pick up their pasta
		or have it delivered. I also added in a delivery fee of $3. I also made it so that if the user tried to enter their 
		customer details twice the program asks them whether they want to clear the previous details or if the original details were correct and 
		continue back to main menu. In this sprint, I also made it so that if order_list is empty and the user tries to review their order, 
		"You have nothing in your order" prints. In the next sprint, I am going to make a confirm_order function where the user can confirm 
		their order. </h4>

<h3> If the user tries to confirm order without any pasta in thier order. This is what the

</h3>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_6_nopasta.jpg" alt=""> 

<h3>Sprint 6 Review</h3>
<h4> In the sprint, I added a confirm_order function which enables the user to be able to see their customer details and 
	order and then confirm order if they want to. The function checks if both customer_details and order_list is not empty.
	If either is empty the program will print either "You have no pastas in your order. Order a pasta before you confirm your order" or 
	"You have not entered your customer details. You cannot confirm order without filling out your customer details first". If they 
	are both not empty, then both information about the customer details and the users order is printed. The user can then either confirm 
	order or not confirm order in which they will be sent back to the main menu. The key problem at the moment is validation. None of the user
	inputs are validated so in the next sprint I will be validating all user inputs.

	<h3>The output above shows some key examples of validation in my program. </h3>

	<h3>Sprint 7 Review</h3>
	<h4> In this sprint, I validated all the user inputs. This means that no input should cause an error. I put some of
		this validation in the get_string and get_integer function but also made a lot of loops for the strings. In this sprint, I also
		tried to make the program more user friendlly with nicer and clear messages to the user so it is easy to use. In both the add to order 
		and delete from order function if the user enters a index that is not availible. The error message "You have not entered a valid number"
		will print and if the user enter anything thats not a number an error message "You have not entered a number" will print. When ever the user
		has a choice between either certain letters and the user doesn't press the right letter. An error message will also print. Telling the user
		to try again. When collecting the delivery and pick up details, there are certain requirements that the user needs to meet. 
		The users name must be 2 letters or longer. The users phone number must only contain digits and be inbetween 5 - 12 numbers long. 
		And for delivery the address must be 5 or more characters long. If the user fails to follow the requirements an message will print
		and then they will be able to try again. In this sprint, I also realised that if the user tried to delete pasta when they didn't have any
		pasta in the order, it caused a problem. So I added in checking if order_list is empty before continuing in the delete_from_order function. 
	</h4>

	<h3>Final Code</h3>
	<h4>I edited a few parts of my code after sprint 7. Mainly only small things. But one of the main things I did change is that 
		when the user tries to enter anything other than numbers when entering their phone number it will not work and they will have to 
		enter it again only with numbers. 
	</h4>

	<h3>This is evidence of the final push to github</h3>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/final_git_push.jpg" alt=""> 

	
<h2>Addressing Relevant Implications</h2>

<h3>Usability</h3>
<h4>In my program, the Usability implication can be seen 
	as I created validation functions to ensure appropriate entry. All the 
	user inputs are validated with clear messages to help the user fix their error and 
	move foward with the appropriate actions. I also used a simple menu system which was like 
	a home screen. This is make it easy for the users to work the program as the home screen makes 
	it clear to the user the options availible. 
</h4>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<h4> In my program, I have shown the functionality implication as I thoroughly tested at the end of each sprint to make sure that 
	everything was working as I intended. I also ran a full user test with a real user to test the program
	under unpredictable conditions. This is so that I can make sure that my program does not crash and is working as intended. 
</h4>

<h3> Sustainability and Future Proofing</h3>
<h4> The sustainability and future proofing implication is shown in my program 
	as I have used a function based build where every each feature is a function. For each new feature, 
	you can create a new function and it does not impact what is already there. This makes it  
	easy to add on new features in the future. My whole program is also commented and doctyped which 
	would make it easier if another developer was to try to understand it.
